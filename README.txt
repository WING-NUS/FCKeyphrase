README.txt              - This file
database.yml            - Not included in repo. This file should contain
                          database configurations written in YAML. Keys needed
                          are host, database, username, password, and socket.
database.yml.template   - Template file for database.yml (see database.yml)
document.rb             - ActiveRecord class to represent a document. Used to
                          cache keyphrases (stored in YAML) using DOI as an
                          index key
document_controller.rb  - Controller class to manage Document instances
generate_xml.rb         - Script file used to generate the keyphrase.xml
                          definition file
jquery-1.7.1.min.js     - Used by generate_xml.rb to generate the XML file
keyphrase.js            - Used by generate_xml.rb to generate the XML file
keyphrase.rb            - Used by public/keyphrase.cgi to extract keyphrases
                          for a given text
keyphrase.xml           - Not included in repo. This file is the xml
                          definition file to be used to create the SciVerse
                          application. The file is generated by generate_xml.rb
keyphrase.rhtml         - Used by generate_xml.rb to generate the XML file
keyphrase.yaml          - Misc prefs used by generate_xml.rb to generate the
                          XML file
prepare_database.sql    - SQL commands to build the table for the cache

====================
public Directory        - Only this directory should be made publicly visible.
                          The other scripts above should be placed in a separate
                          location, e.g. just symlink the public directory to a public
                          location.
keyphrase.cgi           - cgi script to handle requests. If only a doi is
                          supplied, an empty string is returned if the
                          document is not already in the cache. To process a
                          document, supply the cgi with the text as well

====================
extractor Directory     - binaries, libraries, and data used to build models for
                          keyphrase extraction. The ruby script keyphrase.rb
                          provides an abstraction over using the binaries here
                          to obtain a keyphrase from a given text
